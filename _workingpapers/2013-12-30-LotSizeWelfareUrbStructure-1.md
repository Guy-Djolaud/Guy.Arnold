<small> This paper investigates the trajectory of labour market concentration among immigrants in the 
years following their arrival in Canada, using tax administrative data. We find that immigrants 
initially enter labour markets with higher concentrations of foreign-born workers. However, this 
concentration gradually declines over time, reflecting a transition toward more competitive and 
diverse employment environments as immigrants integrate. These findings contribute to a broader 
understanding of immigrant labour market assimilation and highlight the role of labour market 
power in shaping their employment trajectories. </small>
